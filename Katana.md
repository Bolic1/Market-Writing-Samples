## Intro
Generating yield in crypto comes with its own daunting learning curve. Being an effective performer in the yield farming space within crypto it takes a sizeable amount
knowledge on-chain, consistent search for new information and projects, and when dealing with a lot of capital—a development background to audit contracts becomes neccesary
as well. All of that typically turns most participants away from yield farming. 

In this current environment, most of this is walled off to the new participant, who typically will default to some form of trading/investing instead. Some projects have
been developed to take advantage of this gap and charge for access to yield generating strategies. From an adoption standpoint, this does not bode well for crypto generally.
Leaving space for projects to develop products that make yield generating easy and accessible for all market participants, and for developers to contribute and build yield 
strategy based products.

On top of the aforementioned, Solana right now has one of the lowest barriers for entry of any chain (BSC in contention). With avg tx fee sitting under $0.001, finality time
under 0.5 seconds, and tps of 50,000—it's a chain who's dapps are set up with a high potential for growth in user count.

## Single Staking Option Vaults (SSOV)
Single staking option vaults allow users to lock up tokens for a specified period of time and earn yield on their staked tokens. Users are able to deposit tokens into a contract
which then sells those deposits as call options to buyers at fixed strikes. SSOV depositors will received yield proportional to how close to ATM strikes are being locked into.
Users are able to do this without any prior knowledge on options, opening up the ability to perform strategies such as selling covered calls at low risk.

Option vaults on DeFi exploded in TVL in 2021, becoming the domninant part of the $700 million in DeFi option TVL at the end of the year.

The yields generated from these vaults are also sustainable long term as users are able to utilize a wide array of products, and not a set basket of products that are
directionally biased.


## Katana thesis
Katana is focused on simplifying yield generation on Solana. It does so by packaging yield generating option strategies in DeFi into accessible products. Offering a multitude of
of products based on different strategies such as [covered calls](https://www.vantagepointsoftware.com/blog/Covered-Calls/) and [selling puts](https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put). With these products users
are able to build a portfolio to adjust exposure (more products to come such as Delta hedging and other options strategies).

The Katana team, in their view, believes the yield generation process on Solana and crypto generally to be fragmented and manual. In today's digital age, this is a foreign experience
for most users and it allows Katana the space to establish a new yield generation primitive. Add that to the low barrier for entry and scalability of Solana, there is a lot of
growth potential for this protocol. Leveraging the scalibility and low txs fees of Solana, users on Katana can easily swap in and out of yield generating products based on current market conditions and desired
risk exposure.

Adding to this user experience, Katana's vaults are also **tax-efficient**. Katana's vaults automate and execute a strategy on behalf of the protocol, opposed to an individual 
incurring taxable events on each transaction if they were to manualy execute the same strategies.


### Structured products currently on offer
- Covered calls and put selling strategies for popular assets (launched with main net in Dec '21).
- Sustainable yield, generated by expressing a market view.
- Abstracts away the complexity of the underlying derivative strategies with a simplified user experience.
- Fully automated for the users, automatically rolling over positions at the end of each period, making it easy for users to passively earn.

### Automated Vault Strategies include:
- Passive strategy to earn yield on a base asset.
- Wide variety of yield farming opportunities.
- As new opportunities arise and development continues, strategies will change, enabling depositors to consistently earn the best yields available.
- Fully automated execution for the user.
